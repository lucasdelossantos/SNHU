#CS230: Operating Platforms
***Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?***

The Gaming Room is a software company that produced a game called Draw it or Lose it on the Android platform. The clients wished for the game to be developed on a web platform in order to reach more users. 

***What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?***

My stronger suit was around the recommendations particularly in terms of deployment and setting up scalable and secure implementations to meet the demand of users.

***What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?***

The UML diagram was useful in determining how the classes worked together and gave me a visual representation of understanding how it all came together.

***If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?***

I would give almost everything an overhaul due to missing various parts of the assignments since they were not defined in the written assignments but were called out in class announcements which I fail to check. This is partially due to my lack of attention to this class due to work schedule and overall poor time management. 

***How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?***



***How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?***
