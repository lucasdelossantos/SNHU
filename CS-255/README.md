# Module Eight Journal


- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    The DriverPass project is a hypothetical client where you need to collect requirements and perform a system analysis. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online classes and practice exams for written driving tests. 

    The system they tasked us to design would be an all inclusive system which included driving lesson scheduling, practice tests, study material, and online classes to aid students in passing all aspects of their driving tests.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    My revision would focus on the various UML diagrams to make a more detailed flow of the use cases. One that especially stands out to be is the UML Class diagram where I didn't include the methods. 
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I reviewed the interview transciption multiple times and took their basic concepts and expanded upon them for functionality and taking security into account. Ultimately a client has a vision of what they need and they convey this vision as best as possible. By incrementally revising the implementation you and the customer will be satisfied with the outcome. 
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    Before this class I generally would create things in a linear fashion by thinking out the steps and then just getting to coding it. Doing it this way can certainily create stoppping points in where I have to double back and redo or add functionality due to seeing potential race conditions, bugs, etc that can occur. From my perspective the most useful for me was the UML diagrams in terms of visual representation. It creates a better sandbox to suss out the design and add as much logic and use cases as possible before committing to coding.
